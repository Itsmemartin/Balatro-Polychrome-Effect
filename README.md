# Balatro-Polychrome-Effect
This is my very first attempt at writing anything in GLSL. The code may be a bit rough or even botched in places. 

It generates a simple pulsing radial warp effect with shifting colors; AKA the Polychrome Visual Effect from the game Balatro.
Now i know that this may not be a 1:1 and that i could have scoured the game's source code to find it, but thats not as fun as learning something new

As I mentioned before, my craftsmanship is likely best described as shoddy, but it fulfilled a need of mine and opened a way for me into GLSL!

Im interested in what I'll cook up next.
